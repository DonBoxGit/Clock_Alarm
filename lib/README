  Timer_Blink library organizes the time delay and the time switch state.
To create an object, need to apply the constructor the Timer and as 
parameter to point time as milliseconds.
For example:
  Timer displayShowTimer(2000);
 Now, to check the status of object, use the ready() method, which returns
true every 2 seconds.

The resetCounter() method is resseting the milliseconds counter.
The setPeriod(period) method is sestting the period manually in millisecond. 

  The Blink class is creating object which to switch the state from true to
false and back. And to check the status object, use getStatus() method, which
returns boolean value.
  Methods resetStatus() and toggle() is resseting and toggle status manually
accordingly.
